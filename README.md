Social Concentration Game
=======================
This is a social concentration game that mimics the card game called [Concentration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)). In the basic game of concentration, all cards are laid down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over matched pairs. This repo is a rendition of that game using LinkedIn connections. Users can login via LinkedIn and then fetch all their connections' names and profile pictures. Two cards will be created for each connection--one for the name and one for the photo. Players win by turning cards over and finding all the matches.
